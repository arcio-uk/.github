## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is the Arcio Github page, this has our opensource code to show what we've been up to in the project. Our intention was to create an attendance system which could be versitile enough for a variety of different educational institutions to use, then in the future, we intended on turning it into a general Management Information System (MIS) to replace outdated systems. 

Unfortunately we just didn't have the time that was required to finish this project, however we've decided to have this as a showcase for the projects we're capable of doing!
